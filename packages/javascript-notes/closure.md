## Background
A closure is the combination of a function along with references to its lexical environment. Closures are created in JavaScript every time a function is created, at creation time.
In other words, a closure gives us access to an outer functionâ€™s scope from an inner function. Put another way, this inner function has access to the context in which they were created, i.e. their lexical environments. Closures are a feature of JavaScript - not every programming language supports this feature.
It allows for private properties of objects by putting them in the constructor function. [[public and private properties of objects]]
You really have to read [Closures - JavaScript | MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures) to see some more examples.
