# using mixins

As you have seen, behavior is shared through inheritance. However, there are cases when inheritance is not the best solution. Inheritance does not work well for unrelated objects like Bird and Airplane. They can both fly, but a Bird is not a type of Airplane and vice versa.

For unrelated objects, itâ€™s better to use _mixins_. A mixin allows other objects to use a collection of functions.

```javascript
let flyMixin = function(obj) {
  obj.fly = function() {
    console.log("Flying, wooosh!");
  }
};
```

The flyMixin takes any object and gives it the fly method.
