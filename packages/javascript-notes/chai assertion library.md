* Chai provides `expect(<expression-to-be-evaluated-about-which-an-assertion/expection-is-to-be-made>)`. To complete an expect or should style assertion, one needs to use a combo Language Chains and Methods described below:
	* Language Chains
		* to
		* be
		* been
		* is
		* that
		* which
		* and
		* has
		* have
		* with
		* at
		* of
		* same
		* but
		* does
		* stiill
	* Methods
		* not
		* deep - causes all assertions that follow in the chain to use deep equality instead of strict equality
